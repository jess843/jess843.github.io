  Hi! That's me above. I'm currently a high school student attending Richardson High School. I'll be graduating in June of 2019.
</p>

I am interested in Computer Science, trending technologies, and learning new things. Outside of school, I enjoy participating in hackathons, programming contests, and Capture The Flags.


During the summer of 2018 I interned at [State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/) in the Info security department. I worked on the State Farm CTF, helping replenish the challenge set.

Thanks for visiting my website! If you want, check out my github: [@jessdejong](https://github.com/jessdejong).
