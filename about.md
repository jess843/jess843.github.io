  Hi! I'm currently a high school student attending Richardson High School. I'll be graduating in June of 2019.
</p>

I am interested in Computer Science, trending technologies, and learning new things. At RHS, I am part of the Computer Science, Math and Science, Cybersecurity, and Speech and Debate clubs. Outside of school, I enjoy participating in hackathons, programming contests, and Capture The Flags.

My most notable hackathon project was [Simply Aware](https://github.com/Sinister-Paradox/EARTHACKS) for HackDFW/EarthHacks, an app that mapped the spread of diseases.

During the summer of 2018 I interned at [State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/) in the Info security department. I worked on the State Farm CTF, helping replenish the challenge set.

Thanks for visiting my website! If you want, check out my github: [@jessdejong](https://github.com/jessdejong). You can email me at <jessdejong843@gmail.com>.
